    (This is generally not a problem, but if this increases further then OutOfMemoryExceptions
    may occur.
    If memory errors do occur, either increase memory allocation or sort the bam-file by name
    and rerun with the '--nameSorted' option.
    This might also indicate that your dataset contains an unusually large number of
    chimeric read-pairs. Or it could occur simply due to the presence of genomic
    loci with extremly high coverage. It may also indicate a SAM/BAM file that 
    does not adhere to the standard SAM specification.)
